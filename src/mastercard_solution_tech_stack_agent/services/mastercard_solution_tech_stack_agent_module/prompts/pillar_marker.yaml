  Based on the previous conversation, check if the user has already provided an answer to the following question or if the answer can be reasonably inferred:

  {question}

  Use the following rules:
  - If the answer is available or can be inferred, set "answer_ready" to true and provide the inferred "answer".
  - If the question is irrelevant, set "answer_ready" to true and set "answer" to "irrelevant".
  - If the answer is not available, set "answer_ready" to false, leave "answer" as an empty string, and return a follow-up "question" that is clear, concise, and encourages a detailed user response.

  Respond strictly in valid JSON format with double-quoted keys.

  Example:
  {{{{
    "answer_ready": false,
    "answer": "",
    "question": "How do you envision users interacting with your platform? Web app, mobile app, or both?"
  }}}}

  Do not include any comments, explanations, or extra text. Only return a valid JSON object.
